# Netlify Core Workshop

In this workshop, you will learn how to create your first composable website with Netlify. You'll learn features of the Netlify platform, and will deep dive into core primitives.

The site showcasing all workshop examples is available here: [https://netlify-core-workshop.netlify.app](https://netlify-core-workshop.netlify.app)

## What are we going to learn?

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

- Create your first site on Netlify
- Trigger builds with Git and embrace a CI/CD workflow
- Create Deploy Previews and collaborate using the Netlify Drawer
- Securely manage environment variables in the Netlify CLI and UI
- Learn about different caching and page rendering strategies
- Personalize user experiences with Netlify Edge Functions
- Read and write to a globally-distributed data store using Netlify Blobs
- Optimize images on the fly with Netlify Image CDN

## Let's get started

### Local setup and CI/CD workflow

<details><summary>Part 1: Initial setup</summary>

i. [Log in to Netlify](http://app.netlify.com). If you haven't made an account yet, then [sign up](https://app.netlify.com/signup).

ii. Install the [Netlify GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/netlify/installations/select_target) on your org or personal GitHub account if you have not done so already.

iii. Deploy this repo to Netlify! Clicking the button below will copy the contents of this repo into a repo that you control, and create a new site that is linked to your new repo.

<a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/netlify/netlify-workshop">
  <img src="https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg" alt="" title="Deploy to Netlify">
</a>

iv. Clone your new repo, and install dependencies locally.

```bash
git clone <new_repo_url>
cd netlify-workshop
npm i
```

v. Ensure you have the latest version of `netlify-cli` installed globally. Then log in to the CLI, link your repo to your site, and start local dev server

```bash
npm i netlify-cli -g
netlify login
netlify link
netlify dev
```

<details><summary>Part 2: Understanding deploy contexts and CI/CD</summary>

Create a new branch, commit changes, push the branch, and open a pull request.

```bash
git checkout -b feat/bookshelf
git add -A
git commit -m "Adding a list of books to the home page"
git push origin feat/bookshelf
```

You should see a link to the Deploy Preview as a comment by the Netlify bot on the pull request. Pushing to an open pull request [will kick off a new build](https://www.netlify.com/products/build/) in the Continuous Integration pipeline, and you can inspect the deploy logs as the build is building and deploying.

In addition to deploy logs, the Netlify UI gives you access to function logs as well. You can change the region a function executes by changing the region selector in **Site configuration > Build & deploy > Functions**.

In the Deploy Preview itself, you'll notice a floating toolbar anchored to the bottom of your screen. This is the [Netlify Drawer](https://www.netlify.com/products/deploy-previews/). You and your teammates can use this to leave feedback to each other about the Deploy Preview. Any comments you make will sync back to the pull request on GitHub (or any Git service that you may use).

Back in the pull request, merge to main. This will kick off a production build. Every deploy is [atomic](https://jamstack.org/glossary/atomic/) and [immutable](https://jamstack.org/glossary/immutable/), which makes [instant rollbacks](https://docs.netlify.com/site-deploys/manage-deploys/#rollbacks) a breeze.

In your local repo, sync up with the changes from `main` again:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

</details>

<details><summary>Part 3: Share environment variables with your team</summary>

You can manage environment variables in the UI and CLI.

Go to **Site configuration > Environment variables** to add site-specific env vars to your site.

In the CLI, enter the following command to create an environment variable that is scoped to the Functions runtime:

```bash
netlify env:set OPENAI_KEY <YOUR_VALUE> --scope functions
```

### Platform features

<details><summary>Part 1: Getting acquainted with the Netlify UI</summary>

Here, we'll take a quick segue from our CLI and dev environment to showcase more features from the Netlify UI.

- Deploy logs
- [Log Drains](https://docs.netlify.com/monitor-sites/log-drains/)
- [Analytics](https://docs.netlify.com/monitor-sites/site-analytics/)
- [Real User Metrics](https://docs.netlify.com/monitor-sites/real-user-metrics/)
- [Site protections](https://docs.netlify.com/security/secure-access-to-sites/site-protection/)
- [Slack notifications](https://docs.netlify.com/integrations/slack-app/)

</details>

<details><summary>Part 2: High-level overview of platform primitives</summary>

Here, we'll list out use cases and limitations of core primitives, and why you would choose one over the other.

- Functions
- Edge Functions
- Blobs
- Image CDN

</details>

### Platform primitives

<details><summary>Part 1: Configuring headers, proxies, and redirects</summary>

Inside your publish directory (for this repo, `/public`), add a `_redirects` file that contains the following:

```
/*  /index.html  200
```

For every fallthrough case (i.e. whenever a route is accessed and there isn't a file match), it will now redirect back to `/index.html`, where `react-router` will route accordingly.

Similar to the `_redirects` file is the `_headers` file. Here you can set custom headers for routes of your choosing. Create a `/public/_headers` file, and save the following:

```
/*
  X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
```

This will prevent your site from being loaded in an iframe, a technique that help your site prevent [clickjacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking) attacks.

You can also configure both redirects and headers inside the `/netlify.toml` file. Here is the `netlify.toml` equivalents of the above:

```
[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "SAMEORIGIN"
```

</details>

<details><summary>Part 2: Rendering techniques and caching strategies</summary>

i. Purge cache of specific tags using an API call

```bash
curl -X POST 'https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/purge' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"site_id":"$SITE_ID","cache_tags":["books"]}'
```

ðŸ’¡ Learn more about [caching](https://docs.netlify.com/platform/caching/) in our docs.

</details>

<details><summary>Part 3: Going serverless with Functions</summary>

```typescript
export const config: Config = {
  method: "GET",
  path: "/api/books{/:id}?",
};
```

ðŸ’¡ The `path` parameter follows the [URL Pattern API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL_Pattern_API) spec.

ðŸ’¡ Learn more about [Functions](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/) in our docs.

</details>

<details><summary>Part 4: Run middleware and personalize with Edge Functions</summary>

We're going to make a swag section of the site that is personalized to the user based on their geolocation. Edge functions act as middleware for the CDN &mdash; they run in front of other routes!

i. Edge Functions are also great places to add A/B testing. You can add a cookie at the edge to segment user traffic into groups (also known as buckets) to run experimentation. Set a new cookie in `netlify/edge-functions/abtest.ts`:

```diff
+ // set the new "ab-test-bucket" cookie
+ context.cookies.set({
+   name: bucketName,
+   value: newBucketValue,
+ });

  return response;
```

<details><summary>Part 5: Globally persist data with Blobs</summary>

Here, we'll discuss how to read and write data to blob storage.

</details>

<details><summary>Part 6: Optimize images at runtime with Image CDN</summary>

Here, we'll discuss how easy it is to optimize images at runtime with Image CDN.
